SOUND-CTRL

  A naive script of controlling your computer by sound.
  NOTE: This script has *NO* speech recognition feature.

  The work flow is:
    1. Capture a period (0.1s for now) raw PCM sound from 
       microphone, using pyalsaaudio:
          http://pyalsaaudio.sourceforge.net/
    2. Filter out the "silient" periods by simply compare
       avarage to a threshold.
    3. Do FFT and get the base frequency, using scipy&numpy:
          http://www.scipy.org/
    4. Esecute commands according to the base frequency.

TODO
  The script is currently written in python, consuming about
less than 10% of cpu which might be reduced by setting the
threshold to ALSA instead of applying it after a capture and
less than 15MB of resident RAM which is pretty acceptable to me.
  I'm always considering re-write it in C/C++, but at this time
I'm just too lazy to do that...
